## 1. What / Where are the 3 heavens? Please draw. (L3)
(Please review and draw by yourself)
|1st Heaven   |2nd Heaven   |3rd Heaven|
|---|---|---|
|  the heaven within the atmosphere, "the water below", the sky [Ge1:28]() | the heaven of the firmament, the expanse, the space, the universe, "the water above" (finite) [Ge1:6-8]()   | the heaven where gods are, the ***spiritual heaven***, outside the universe, where the Father's House is  |
|Governed by men|Governed by the ruler of the air [Eph2:2](), [Job1:7]()|Governed by God only|

1st and 2nd Heavens are the ***material heaven*** that will become burning hell one day.

## 2. What are the two approaches to reading the Bible, and which one should we use? Why? (L1)
| Greek thinking  |Hebrew thinking   |
|---|---|
|   Asking "How?"| Asking "Why?"   |
|Method-driven|Purpose-driven|
|Man-centered(Anthropocentrism)| God-centered(Theocentricism)|
|Humanistic View| Theistic View|
|Leads to no faith, no God, no Jx, no salvation|Leads to knowing God, God's will, purpose, plan, gaining faith, meeting Jx, having eternal life|

When we approach Bible, we should always use HT that acknowledges God's mighty power and more importantly it will let us understand the purpose of God's miracles and wonders, and it will lead us to know the will of God; however the GT will let man miss the purpose and plan of God.

## 3. Is Christianity a religion? Please explain (L4)
Christianity is not a religion. Appearance of similarity, but fundamentally different.

|Religion   |Christianity   |
|---|---|
|   General, natural faith| Faith by revelation, faith by grace   |
|Through doctrine(教义；信条), rituals(程序；仪规；礼节) and organizations|Through the revealed Word of God|
|Upward (Men trying to attain to God)|Downward (God came to man, given word)|

Men cannot know God through religiosity. God gave men not religion but His Son, not doctrine but fact - ***the Word in the beginning became flesh*** and came to us, finished the redemptive work to give sinners like us a chance to respond to this divine call and be saved. It starts with God, and is the amazing grace of God. No religion promises salvation by grace through faith ***in God's redemption through Jx*** like in Christianity.

## 4. Explain the Law and the Gospel - Definition, Purpose, Result? (L8)
|   | The Law  |The Gospel|
|---|---|---|
| It is ...  |The conscience of God, the righteousness of God   |The freedom from conscience [Jn8:32]()|
|Definition|No one is righteous [Rm3:10]() (the law of condemnation, the law of sin and death)|The righteous will live by faith [Rm1:17]() By faith in the redemptive work of Jx, we can be justified as righteous|
|Purpose|The condemn [Rm3:19]() All men in Adam are sinners|To reveal the righteousness of God [Rm1:17]() (Jesus)|
|Result|The price of sin is death [Rm6:23]() All are doomed to go to hell to pay our price|Eternal life [Rm5:20-21] Simply by believing and receiving, one's debts of sin have been fully paid by Jx, one can then have eternal life instead of eternal punishment in the fire of hell|


## 5. Explain the incarnation of the Word, and the purpose of this. Please cite Bible verses. (L6)
- the incarnation of the Word [Jn1:1-3]()<br>
The essence / very nature of the Word is God [Php2:6]()<br>
The Word became flesh, God became flesh, Spirit became flesh [Jn1:14]()<br>
His flesh = spirit; His blood = spirit

- Why did the Word become flesh?
1. ***to die***: for redemption (pay the price of sin for all) [Mt20:28](), at the Father's command [Jn10:18]()
1. ***to shed blood***: to cleanse, forgive sins [lev17:11]() (atonement), [He9:22](); and give life [Jn6:63]()

## 6. What is God's schedule, predestination, and providence? What should we do when facing providence? Use an example to explain. (L10)

| God's schedule  | Predestination   |Providence|
|---|---|---|
|  God's divine decision, timetable, dispensation |   Establishing parts| Pre-video ("See ahead")|
|Before creation, unilateral, the "Script"|Before creation, the "roles / parts" to the script|Becoming "casting", when God's will meets men|

God's schedule never changes, and will be fulfilled regardlessly. The predestination is also set by God unilaterally for the schedule to be complete. However, providence is God's calling for man to partake in His plan and will. It's bilateral, and individual maa are now given a chance to partake or not.

When one seizes the chance and carries out even if there is risk and burden involved, there will be blessing; yet if one does not carry out, there will be lack of blessing, which is curse - however, the will of God continues.

(Give one example - Noah building ark for 70 years, Abraham leaving homeland / sacrificing Issac, Rebecca helping Jacob stealing blessing, virgin Mary giving birth to Jx, disciples of Jx ...
<br> When describe, following the format: <br>
God's specific calling - risk / burden involving - individual take the risk to obey God's instruction - blessing)

## 7. What is the Truth?
1. The words of the Father <br>
    [Jn17:17]() Sanctify them by (or them to live in accordance with) the truth; your word is truth.
1. Jesus Himself <br>
    [Jn14:6]() Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
1. The words of Jesus <br>
    [Jn14:24]() Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
1. Word of the H.S <br>
    [Jn14:26]() But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

Truth is the law that surpass the Law of Moses.
Truth is the law that surpass the natural law and the natural principles.

## 8. What is the Ethics of faith and the Ethic of faith life? Please explain the difference. Which should we prioritize? [Mt10:37-39](); [Lk9:59-60]() (L10)
ethic (伦理学；道德准则；伦理标准；道德体系)

| Ethics of faith  |Ethics of faith life   |
|---|---|
| 1st - 4th of the 10 commandments  | 5th - 10th of the 10 commandments  |
|regarding relationship with God| regarding relationship among men|
|ethics regarding God| ethics regarding men|
|if break, against God, "sin"|if break, against men, "transgression(违反；罪过)" (weight differs)|

We should always prioritize the ethics of faith. God is the trust-worthy rock, if we trust God, we put everything else in His hand. God created us, therefore knows our every care, but His will is wanting us to treat Him the right way, loving Him more than anything else, because He alone is worthy. E.g. Abraham sacrifices his one and only Son. In [Mt10:37]() and [Lk9:59]() Jesus demanded priority of "following Him" than "honoring one's parents", because He is God who came as man. Therefore, we need to follow Jx first.

## 9. What is Faith and self-confidence? What are the differences? Which should we choose? (L6)
| Self-confidence  |Faith   |
|---|---|
| faith of natural people  |  faith of God |
|self-assurance|the assurance(保证；担保) of God|
|subjective|objective|
|Based on one's experience and knowledge|Based on the Word of God|
|Probability of success|100% of God's success|

What makes Peter walk on the water? The command of Jesus. When He commands, I obey, that obedience makes me experience miracles, because it's guaranteed by the unfailing word of God.

We should always choose faith which bases my action solely on the word of God -> 100% success guaranteed by God.

Having faith in God is possessing the faith of God = continually obeying the Word of God (simple obedience)

## 10. Explain the two types of revelation. (L2)
|| The natural revelation  | the higher revelation   |
|---|---|---|
|from who| The Creator  |The Savior   |
|how|through the creation|Through the Son|
|to whom|To all|to believers|
|verses|[Ge1:1](); [Rm1:19-20]()|[Jn1:1-3](), [18](); [He1:1-2]()|

If we have received the natural revelation, we can receive the higher revelation.

The higher revelation: We believe in The Savior; we know the Savior God through the Son; To believers [Jn1:1](), [14](), [18](); [He1:1-2](), having the promise of eternal life.

## 11. 13

## 12. What is the content of Sign. Why is sign important to our faith life? (L12)
content of sign is God with us, Immanuel

We need signs to testify that Yeshua is living and is with me and using me, and that His words are true. Through signs that Jesus is proven to be living today (normal faith), that:

1. Jesus is the true God
1. I am a servant of Jesus
1. I have done everything according to the truth, by obeying His command


## 14. explain "Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God". (L4)
Christ(Greek) / Messiah(Hebrew) = "The Anointed" / King

| Christ  |Yeshua (Jesus)  |
|---|---|
| King  |The name of God   |
|the Son of Man|The Son of God|
|The mission of coming in the flesh|To whosoever believes, through the Holy Spirit|
|Death, resurrection, ascension, the throne, the return|Immanuel (God with us)|
|Highlighting the duty / mission in the flesh|Highlighting deity, the Name given to us, in me, blood came through the Name|


## 15. Explain three types of spiritual beings in the Bible
| God  |Angels   |Men|
|---|---|---|
| Transcendent(极其伟大的, 超越认识的事物)  |Intermediary(中间人；调解人)   |Limited|
|The Creator, the beginning and the end [Rev22:13]()|Ministers, servants [He1:7](), [14]()|Partners [1Co3:9](), heirs [Rm8:17]()|


## 16. Who was John the the Baptist and why is it important? There is the one about whom it is written [Mt11:10]() who is this messenger? (L9)

John the Baprist was a lamp, the Elijah to come, the last Prophet. <br>
Prophets are called to prepare the way for the messiah.<br>
if you see John as Elijah -> then Jesus is the messiah.<br>
Jesus is the Messiah and the light of life. [Jn1:4]() <br>
As soon as Jesus starts to preach, the true light comes, then lamp is no longer necessary. So John the baptist died.

## 17. explain the purpose of the coming of the Son. (Why did God send the Son of God / Man?) (L7)
To die to:

1. glorify the Father [Php2:6-11]() - mission completed at the cross
1. destroy the devil [1Jn3:8]()
1. save mankind [Jn3:16]() - all giving glory to Yeshua, Father receives glory.
