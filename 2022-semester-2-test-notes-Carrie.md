- the flesh of JX (last Adam) and the spirit of all men (1st Adam) are at the ***same*** level
- the flesh of JX is the incarnate Word (Spirit), without sin, the only sinless one, therefore He can pay the price of sin of all men in 1st Adam

## 4. what is the difference between redemption and salvation & eternal life? explain [Rm10:10]() vs [Php2:12]() & [1Pe2:2]()

|  redemption | salvation  | eternal life  |
|---|---|---|
| past(2000 yrs ago)  | present  | future  |
|Jx paid the price of sin through His death|those who believe in the redemption of Jx are forgiven|begins at the time of the resurrection to life|
|"believe this historical fact"|"come out of the wicked world"|"live with the hope of resurrection"|
|"you have been saved" from the past sins [Eph2:8]()|"be saved" in present time [Ac2:40]()|"you will be saved" (achieve when leave the burning universe) in the future [Rm8:23]|
|by believing and receiving the blood of JX|by sustaining salvation with the Word|by becoming the firstfruits of the HS|

[when happened, what happened, what to do with happening, verse of save, how to do it today]

- redemption is the historical fact the Jesus, the son of God who knows no sin, He died on the cross 2000 yrs ago, in place of al men, paid the price of sin.
- Salvation described in [Rm10:10]() = when we believe the redemptino of JX, we receive the blood of JX, and we are forgiven of our past sins, given new life by His redeeming blood
- salvation described in [1Pe2:2](), [Php2:12]() = after we believe, and have the spirit perfectly sanctified by His blood, we have to sustain and work out our salvation. We need to live a holy and sanctified life by continuously obeying the command of JX [Jn17:17](), in the hope of 1st resurrection. Until we died or JX comes back, we need to grow to maturity with faith filled as whole wheat/the firstfruits of the HS. Salvation is not completed/achieved until we leave this universe and enter eternal life.
- eternal life: with the resurrected spiritual body, we will enter into the Holy City, the Father's House, to live with Yeshua forever.

## 5. describe the different 3 functions and construction of man (flesh, soul "the person", spirit)
- man before [Ge2:7]() = flesh (being&function) + persona(function)
- living being (Adam)<br>
= flesh (being&function) + spirit(being&function) + persona(function)<br>
= 2 beings + 3 functions
- flesh: comes from dust, outwardly man
- spirit: comes from God, "the breath of life", inwardly man, the true me
- persona = "soul" / character = intelligence + emotion + free will
- being = to live or die <br>
    - for the flesh to live, it needs to eat food from dust, but it perishes day by day
    - for the  spirit ot live, it needs to eat(obey) the word of God in the form of command, and if so, it will be renewed day by day and led to eternal life



## 6. being saved in the different periods /describe the life after death of believers based on the biblical timeline
todo

[covenant, revelation, commandment of blood] + [saw, received, become testimony/witness of blood] + [life-after-death][]
[]

life-after-death for unbelievers from Noah on: <br>
Stay on earth for 120 yrs, and then thrown into the Abyss. After the Great Judgement, will be thrown into the lake of fire. <br>
1st Resurrection: only for those who live their life as tools of God/Saints [Rev20:8]

## 7. describe the three differenct types of sin

|death of the spirit|curse|curse|
|inherited [Ps51:5]()|not inherited [Eze18:1-4](), [17-18]()|not inherited|

[whose, result, inheritance]
[what to do with past and present/future sins]

- all sins are forgiven when on repents and believes in the redemptive work of JX. By the blood of JX, all sins are washed away, cleansed, and paid for.
- but since we still live in the flesh, we can fall and commit self-commited sin and sin of desire. To remove the curses, we have to painfully repent and resolve to not commit the same sin, continuously pray and obey. By God's grace and help of the HS, we will overcome and be sanctified.

## 8. why do we keep the Lord's day and not the sabbath? describe the significance of the Lord's day
|  sabbath | Lord's Day  |
|---|---|
| remembering the creator God - Jehovah  |remembering the Redeemer God - Yeshua   |
|work of creation|work of redemption|
|7th Day|8th Day/ "Another Day" [He4:8]()|
|the creator God finished His work and entered rest from creation|the redeemer God finished His work of dying as a ransom for many, cleansed sin. Resurrectted, entered into His enternal true rest in the most Holy Place|

remember of [who, what was done, when, details of what was done]
[holiness??, historical background, body of Jesus]

- the essence of Sabbath(time) or the resting environment of God is Holiness. The location is the temple. When JX died and shed His blood, He sanctified the heavenly temple, and at His resurrection, the true holiness was revealed.
- OT people honor the Creator God by setting themselves apart from the work to keep the Sabbath in order to enter the physical rest in the promised land, however, that is only a shadow of the true eternal rest brought by JX after His redemptive work.
- Today, as Christians, we honor our Redeemer, Savior, Yeshua by setting ourselves apart from the world to worship and praise Him as members of His body, to gather in His Church, where JX is the head. In doing so, we revealed our own holiness, hoping to have the same resurrection as His in the future, and enter into that eternal rest.

## 9. describe the trinity God (compare the Father, the Son, the HS)
God is one being in 3 persons. The 3 persons have the same will and work in one accord.

|---|---|---|
| creator  | redeemer  |  Helper |
| Ideaology | visible | experimental |
| outside the universe | within the universe | inside the soul of saints & Church |
| before the creation of the heavens and earth | 2000 yrs ago | after Pentecost |
| He established the will | He fulfilled the will | He is still fulfilling the will |
| the Father that made me | the Father that gave birth to my soul | the Father that nurtures me |

[role, where spawn, when spawn, what did(accomplishment), what it means to me]

## 10. was buddha saved?
He is not saved. Buddha was born inthe era of the Law. He needs to obey the Law and keep the covenant of blood (animal blood) to be saved.<br>
He inherited the original sin in spirit from Adam, he also sinned by breaking the law in many ways (e.g. not keeping the Sabbath) and he had no covenant of blood to cleanse his sins. Because of his sins, he (spirit) went ot Abyss after 120 yrs on earth, and will be thrown into hell after the great judgement

## 11. what was purpose of the coming of the Son of Man
- the purpose: to glorify the Father [Php2:6-11]()
