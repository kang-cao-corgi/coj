# Lec 2
## The bible distinguishes the natural revelation and higher revelation

| natural revelation  | highrt revelation  |
|---|---|
| the creator  | the savior  |
| through the creation| through the son|
| to all| to believers|
|Ge1:1; Rm 1:19-20| Jn1:1-3,14,18; He1:1-2|

- higher revelation can only be received after natural revelation.
  eg. knowledge believe

## The natural revelation
- two major theories on the beginning of life
  1. evolution
  2. creation
## eveolution
Everything formed w/o direction.
the naturalistic ciew
- progressive creation: burst
- theistic evolution: god: let there be creatures, let it happen and evolve
- atheistic evolution: plain evolution learned in school
    #### cosmic evolution
     - the bigbang theory, the universe started with a small singularity, then inflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos of today.
     - but where did that singularity come from?
    #### geological evolution
     - the nebular hypothesis
     - the solar system formed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust 4.6 billion years ago.
     - but stardust particles do not form into planets and planetesimals rather they bounce ooff or collide to explide
     - also the sun should be spinning much faster
     - the solar-nebular model sats eath was formed about 4.5 billion years ago
     - but its strong magnetic field too little sodium in the sea, intact DNA in fossils etc all indicate a YOUNG earth
    #### earth iniqely designed to be out home
    Isia 45:18
    - its strong magnetci field protects us from harmful solar radiation
    - its atmosphere gives us air to breathe
    - our sun is perfectly located within our galaxy; our planet is perfectly located within our solar system
    - its water cycle protects and provides
    #### moon
    - its distance from earth allows its gravity to rise tides for earth
    - its distance and szez allows for eclipses
    - evolution cannot explain its origin, geological activity or its recession for "billions of years"
    #### a total solar eclipse
    - possible becaise the sun is 4 times larger than the moon and 400 times further away
    - because of this configuration ecluoses can be best viewed in earth
    - this configuration also allows for life to exist on earth

## The bibilical creation
- The 6 day creation
- The garden of Eden
- Adam and Eve
- The global flood etc
  - ---
- Ge 1:1 " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
- "Day" = YOM (Hebrew)  = A Solar day Ex20:11
### The theory of evolution
over a long period of time a species evolves to a new one in order to adapt to the environment
### fossiles
- evidence that Charles Darwin used for his theory in *On The Origins Of Species (1859)*
- Q: Adam and Eve on 6th Day?
- Missing Links? ***trasitional fossils***
- The Archaeopteryx: a dinosaur or a bird
### Life from non-life?
- the formation of the first living thing that comes ...
### information of life
- the information that is required to run all the physical parts of life cannot be explained
- the vast amount of the instructions stored in DNA had to come from preexisting information
### what is information?
- the basic ingredient producing anything functional in the world
- the key to functionality is organization
- the fundamental building block of the created universe
### irreducible complexity
Q: 99% human DNA being alike proves nothing of God's Design
- it challenges the notion of evolutionary process that requires every complex component of life arising step-by-step
- *Michael Behe* quote
- species that disapprove evolutionism
    - acid beattle
    - giraffe
    - leaf-cut ant
- is evolution science?
- Scientific approach
    - objective observation
    - experiment: causal relationship criteria analysis
    - evidence
    - demostration: theories and laws
### Evolution and Ceation commons
- both theories make claims about the unobservable and unrepeatable past
- both have the same evidence
- both interpret base on a set of starting assumptions, different paradigms
-  both required ***faith***

### ***Creation acceptes the bible as providing the answer to how, when and why all things came into existence***

- 2Ch2:5

### three different heavens

- 2Ch2:5-6, 6:18
- Ps148:4

|  First heaven |  second |  third |
|---|---|---|
| the heaven within the atmosphere  | the heaven of the firmament, the expanse  | the heaven where ***gods*** are|
| the sky Ge1:28| the space, the universe Ge1:1-2, 6-8| tthe spiritual heaven 2Co12:2|\

### the universe is finite
- Act 1:11
- Jn3:13

### where is god
- 2Ch2:6

### who governs where

| the heaven where gods are  | the heaven of the universe  | the heaven under the clouds|
|---|---|---|
| God  | the ruler of the air (Eph2:2, Job1:7)  | men (Ge1:28)|

### "paradise" or "the father's house"

|  paradise | father's house  |
|---|---|
|  a portion of the third heaven | the third heaven  |

# Lec 4
## Religion, albeit unclearly, demonstrations the common organization and deeds of faith

### Christianity is ***not*** a religion

religion = giving reference to the super natural or transcendent

Christian faith exists without the text

| religion  | christianity  |
|---|---|
| general , natural faith  | faith by revelation, faith by grace  |
| through doctrines, rituals and organization| though the revealed Word of God|
| Upward| Downward|
| man seeking God| God reveals|

### Religiosity vs. Faith
- 1Co15:13-19
- Ac2:32

### you cannot know God through philosophy
Philosophy is the basis?
Could you know god through philosophy?

### Two approaches in philosophy to under stand deity though reason

1. The ontological approach

    (ontological: the state of being)
    - understand god through the external
    - god as the ground of being , the nature of being
    - man cannot be separated to objectify god
    - "Since I exist, god must exist"


    god = "emptyness"
    the immanence throty = god is inseparable from

2. The idealistic approach

    (the mind is the requirement of existence)
    - understand god through the internal
    - god as the origin of the mind
    - the eye cannot see itself
    - the consciousness of man is the consciousness of god

    the divine = nothingness emptiness
    nihilism buddhism reality = nothing

Conclusion: neither philosophy nor religion can know the divine

Mt11:25-27

### Christianity is responding to the divine call

| action  |  confession | acknowledgement|
|---|---|---|
| worship  |  revealing my faith| god's omnipresence|
|repentance| confessing my sins| god's righeousness, omniscience|
|prayer| confessing my inabilites| god's omnipotence|
| praise| confessing my lowliness| god's worthiness|
|tithing| revealing my income| god's ownership of all thins|
|thanksgiving| revealing my life | god's grace and help|


Rm10:10
Jn1:9
### 1. god gave them not religion but his son

#### regarding repentance

| repent Mt3:2  |  repent Mt4:17 | repent Ac2:18|
|---|---|---|
| John the baptist  |  Jesus christ | Apostles|
| correct your knowledge of the deity and righteousness | turn from your direction towards the deity and turn to me|fix your thoughts towrds the deity|

Yeshua is the christ
- Mt16:16
- Ac17:3

"Christ" "Messiah" = the anointed (king)

|  Christ | Yeshua  |
|---|---|
|King   | The name  |
| The son of Man| the son of god|
| the mission of coming in the flesh| to whosoever believes through the Holy Spirit|
|Death, ressurection, ascension, the throne, return| Immanuel (Gos with us)|

#### regarding love
- Mt20:28
- Rm5:6-8
- 1Jn4:10

only in christianity there is the redemption of god

### 2. god gave men not doctrine but fact
- men killed JX but god raised him
- the son of man sent the HS and the HS testifies

- Ac2:3
- Ac5:30-32

### the lord's prayer is not a catechism
#### the content of prayer
- the receiver of prayer
- the purpose of prayer
- the content of prayer

### for his events god calls men and lets them do his work
- Ps23:1

# Lec 5
## 3. The christian mission is not a  religious method, it is declaring the gospel

preach
    - Mt4:10

- to bring good news
- to proclaim/declare

### christianity does ***NOT*** challenge
god is just god, god is not socially just god
- Jn18:36

christian does not discuss or debate but declare

religious pluralism/unity

-Co6:14:18

## 4. Worship is ***NOT*** a religious ritual

the apostle's creed

### worship is seeing the face of the lord
worship - to fall at another's feet

dead sacrifice(old testment)
/ living sacrifice(new testment)???

### the authority of the son of man
- the authority to judge sins (Jn5:27) and forgive sins (Mt9:6)

- Mt26:18; Jn12:23, 17:1
