## Lec 1

# Intro

## Scripture cannot be broken

Jn10:35
> If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside

  refering to old testment, bible cannot be destroyed
  The Word Jn1:1

Jn1:1 before creation
> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Ge1:1 the beginning of creation
> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

"In the beginning" also in Genesis1:1
Ge1:1 beginning of creation
Jn1:1 eternal time where there is no time, when the Word was before creation
What is WORD? the **self-manifestation** of God, everything else was created by God. The plan of human is already there.

The Word is spirit.

Bible is the way we can know God, only through the Bible, we can know the whole logos.

Those who have the Word of God are called ***gods***

What does Logos bible institute teach?<br>
It teaches how to view the bible. It teaches the word.

Do not re-interpret.

# Chapter 1: How to look at the Bible - the "lens"
on way to see, on line in dial.
zoom in and zoom out at different scope.

- the purpose of reading the bible - eternal life <br> Jn5:39
> You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me.

eternal(no time involved, timeless) life is living like God. We must meet **Jesus** in the Bible. Bible is not an object of research. Theology, "theo" means study of God by human. We need approach the God through the Bible.

- The Bible hegins with a story of **3 types of spiritual beings** that are entirely different in their essence.

|God|Angels|Men|
|--|--|--|
|transcendant|intermediary|limited|
the creator, the beginning and the end(Rev22:13)|ministers, servants(He1:7, 14)|partners, heirs(Rm8:17; 1Co3:9)|

Rev22:13
> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.

He1:7, 14
> In speaking of the angels he says,
“He makes his angels spirits,
    and his servants flames of fire.

> Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?

Rm8:17
> Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.

1Co3:9
> For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.

- the main character in the Bible is **Jesus**

Jn8:56-58
> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.” “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!” “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”

- the purpose of the Bible is for man to know God

1Jn2:12-13
> I am writing to you, dear children,
    because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. I am writing to you, fathers,
    because you know him who is from the beginning.
I am writing to you, young men,
    because you have overcome the evil one.

- 2 approaches to read the Bible

|Greek approach| Hebrew approach|
|---|---|
|"how?"|"why"|
|method-driven|purpose-driven|
|man-centered (anthropocentrism)| God-centered (throcentricism)|

"Is God for man?" vs
"Is man for God?"

- **Eternal life** is knowing God who sent **Jesus** as the Son

Jn 17:3
> Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

to know = to experience
- you will konw when you receive the HS

Jn14:17
> the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.

1Co2:10-11
> these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

John's role was to introduce Jesus, after that he is finished (died).

1. we must hear the words of Jesus
1. men are destroyed for not knowing God

Hos4:6
> my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.
“Because you have rejected knowledge,
    I also reject you as my priests;
because you have ignored the law of your God,
    I also will ignore your children.

Hos6:6
> For I desire mercy, not sacrifice,
    and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.

Jn16:2-3
> They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.

3. you will know the Lord

Hos2:19-20
> I will betroth you to me forever;
    I will betroth you in righteousness and justice,
    in love and compassion.
20 I will betroth you in faithfulness,
    and you will acknowledge the Lord.

1Co13:12
> For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

Rev3:20
> Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.

## Lec 2

### The bible distinguishes the natural revelation and higher revelation

| natural revelation   | higher revelation      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| the Creator          | the Savior             |
| through the creation | through the Son        |
| to all               | to believers           |
| Ge1:1; Rm 1:19-20;    | Jn1:1-3,14,18; He1:1-2 |

- higher revelation can only be received after natural revelation.
  eg. knowledge believe

### The natural revelation - Rm1:19-20

- two different views on the origin of life
  1. evolution - everything created w/o creator
  1. creation

---
### evolution

Everything formed w/o direction.
the naturalistic view
- progressive creation: burst
- theistic evolution: god: let there be creatures, let it happen and evolve - directed evolution
- atheistic evolution: plain evolution learned in school

  #### cosmic evolution
  - the bigbang theory, the universe started with a small **singularity**, then inflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos of today.
  - but where did that singularity come from? multi-verse theory, Steve Hawkin - shrink boundary proposal
  #### geological evolution: the nebular hypothesis
  - the solar system formed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust 4.6 billion years ago.
  - but stardust particles do not form into planets and planetesimals rather they bounce off or collide to explide
  - the Earth: the solar-nebular model says the Earth was formed about 4.5 billions years ago. But its strong magnetic field, too little sodium in the sea, intact DNA in fossils etc. all indicate a young Earth
  - also the sun should be spinning much faster
  - the solar-nebular model sats eath was formed about 4.5 billion years ago
  - but its strong magnetic field too little sodium in the sea, intact DNA in fossils etc all indicate a YOUNG earth

    #### The Earth uniqely designed to be our home (Is45:18)
    - its strong magnetic field protects us from harmful solar radiation
    - its atmosphere gives us air to breathe
    - our sun is perfectly located within our galaxy; our planet is perfectly located within our solar system
    - its water cycle protects and provides

    #### The Moon
    - its distance from earth allows its gravity to rise tides for earth
    - its distance and size allows for eclipses
    - evolution cannot explain its origin, geological activity or its recession for "billions of years"

    #### A total solar eclipse
    - possible because the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and 400 times further away
    - because of this configuration eclipses can be best viewed on the earth
    - this configuration also allows for life to exist on earth

---

### The bibilical creation
- The 6 day creation
- The garden of Eden
- Adam and Eve
- The global flood etc

- Ge 1:1 " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
- "Day" = YOM (Hebrew)  = A Solar day

  Ex20:11
  > For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
---
### The theory of evolution
  Over a **gradual time-consuming** process a new speies arises from an existing one trough random spontaneous genetic mutations that give a surviaval advantae in to hostile environment

  ### Fossiles
  - evidence that Charles Darwin used for his theory in *On The Origins Of Species (1859)*
  - Q: Adam and Eve on 6th Day?
  - No found examples of in-between kinds: missing links? ***trasitional fossils***
  - The Archaeopteryx: a dinosaur or a bird?

  ### Puzzles that evolution cannot solve
    #### 1. Life from non-life?
    - The formation of the first living things that comes from nothing cannot be explained.

    #### 2. Information of life (is evidence for creation)
    - the information that is required to run all the physical parts of life cannot be explained
    - the vast amount of the instructions stored in DNA had to come from preexisting information
    - what is information?
      - the basic ingredient producing anything functional in the world
      - the key to functionality is organization
      - the fundamental building block of the created universe

    #### 3. Irreducible complexity
    Q: 99% human DNA being alike proves nothing of God's Design
    - it challenges the notion of evolutionary process that requires every complex component of life arising step-by-step
    - *Michael J. Behe* quote
    - species that disapprove evolutionism
      - the bombardier beattle: 2 chambers
      - giraffe, the valve to prevent blood flowing to head when it bows down
      - leaf-cutter ant
    - is evolution science?
    - Scientific approach
      - objective observation
      - experiment: causal relationship criteria analysis
      - evidence
      - demostration: theories and laws

  ### Is evolution science?
  scientific method:
  - objective observation
  - experiment: caucal relationship, critical analysis
  - evidence
  - demonstration: theories and laws

  ### Evolution and Ceation commons
  - both **theories** make claims about the unobservable and unrepeatable past
  - both have the same evidence
  - both interpret base on a set of starting assumptions, different paradigms
  - both required ***faith***

Evolution denies the role of God in the universe

**Creation acceptes the bible as the foundation for arriving at a correct understanding of the universe, providing the answer to how, when and why all things came into existence**

### The higher revelation

- Jn1:1-3,14,18

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.

> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

- He1:1-2
- 1Jn1:1
- Jn1:16

## Lec 3 Culture


### the human world illustated in the bible is about the mutual and exclusive relationship between culture and faith

Is culture first or faith?
culture = the environment where humans can be humans (live as)

Ge1:28
  > God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground."

Mt4:4
  > Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.

Mt6:31,33
  >  So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or ‘What shall we wear?'

  > But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

Prioritize? faith all the time.
Following Lord's prayer

---

### The causal relationship between culture and faith

When men is tempted by culture, faith is cursed(corrupted), vice versa.

Ps1:3
  > That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers.
Eze47:12
  > Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.
1. challenging god because of food

    Ge3:1-14

2. hardship in life because of the coruption of faith

    Ge3:15-21

3. the invisible flaming sword
    Ge3:22-24

    Dt28:30-34

    there is no earthly paradise, human can create society that is promised to be like paradise. In fact, there is no paradise on Earth any more.

4. when your faith reaches to God you will lose the world

    Ge4:1-8

5. the judgement of God brings out the fear among men

    Ge4:9-14

6.  the protection of God stops the tribulation of culture

    Ge4:15

7. seeing the daughters of men, the sons of God became corrupted

    Ge6:1-2

---

### Heaven

### The bible differentiates ***three heavens*** that are distinct in level and describes the events that develop in them

2Ch2:5-6, 6:18

> The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?

> But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The ***heavens***, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!

Ps148:4

> Praise him, you highest ***heavens*** and you waters above the skies.
### Three different heavens

| First heaven                     | second                                   | third                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| the heaven within the atmosphere | the heaven of the firmament, the expanse | the heaven where ***gods*** are |
| the sky Ge1:28                   | the space, the universe Ge1:6-8     | the spiritual heaven 2Co12:2   |

small g gods -> angels

#### the universe is finite

Act 1:11

> "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."

Jn 3:13

> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.

#### where is God?
God is omnipresent. the Son is in heaven.

2Ch2:6

> But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?

#### the universe
Ge1:1-2, 6-7

### who governs where

| the heaven where gods are | the heaven of the universe            | the heaven under the clouds |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| God                       | the ruler of the air (Eph2:2, Job1:7) | men (Ge1:28)                |

### "paradise" or "the father's house"

| paradise                        | father's house                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| a portion of the third heaven   | the third heaven                      |
| souls of believers(Lk23:43) | in resurrected body (Jn14:2-3, 20:17) |

paradise: a spiritual space which is part of the third heaven.

---
### Hell

prepared mechanism of punishment for devils

#### When will anyone be thrown into hell

- Mt25:31-41
- Jude1:6
- Rev20:15

#### Where is hell

- Is14:15
- Rev20:14
- Rev21:1
- 2Pe3:7

#### believers to paradise

- Lk23:43

#### "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"

- Mt6:10
- Rev12:7-9

---

## Lec 4

## Religion, albeit unclearly, demonstrations the common organization and deeds of faith

### Christianity is ***not*** a religion

religion = giving reference to the super natural or transcendent

Christian faith exists without the text

| religion                                    | christianity                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| general, natural faith                     | faith by revelation, faith by grace |
| through doctrines, rituals and organization | though the revealed Word of God     |
| Upward                                      | Downward                            |

### Religiosity vs. Faith

- 1Co15:13-19
- Ac2:32

### you cannot know God through philosophy

Philosophy is the basis of knowledge?
Could you know god through philosophy?

#### Two approaches in Greek philosophy to understand *deity though reason*

1. The ontological approach

    (ontological: the state of being/existence)
   - "God is that, the greater than which cannot the conceived(感知)" - Anselm of Canterbury
   - "I have concluded the evident existence depends entirely on God in all the moments of my life,
   that I do not think that the human spirit may know anything with greater evidence and certitude(确信)" - Rene Descartes
   - understand god through the external
   - God as the ground of being , the nature of being
   - man cannot be separated to objectify God
   - "Since I exist, god must exist"
   - "I become the divine, the divine becomes me" - the concluding statement

    god = "emptyness"<br>
    the immanence theory / pantheism = god is inseparable from<br>
    you canont prove/disprove existence of God<br>

2. The idealistic approach

    (the mind is the requirement of existence)

   - understand god through the internal

   - god as the origin of the mind

   - the eye cannot see itself

   - the consciousness of man is the consciousness of god

   - the divine = nothingness, emptiness, meaninglessness<br>
     nihilism(尼采) <-> buddhism: reality being empty, full of suffering because of cravings, nothing is permanent, nothing is cause-less

Conclusion: neither philosophy nor religion can know the divine. the only way is through revelation

Mt11:25-27

> At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

*children* are those who are pure-minded and bumble-hearted.

### The Bible offers evidence for Faith: the resurrection of Jesus
- 1Co15:13-19
- Ac2:32

### Christianity is responding to the divine call

Christianity is a faith of confession

| action       | confession               | acknowledgement                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| worship      | revealing my faith       | God's omnipresence              |
| repentance   | confessing my sins       | God's righeousness, omniscience |
| prayer       | confessing my inabilites | God's omnipotence               |
| praise       | confessing my lowliness  | God's worthiness                |
| tithing      | revealing my income      | God's ownership of all thins    |
| thanksgiving | revealing my life        | God's grace and help            |

praise: exalt 1. who He is, 2. what He has done and 3. His name

Rm10:10
Jn1:9

#### 1. God gave men not religion but His son

#### regarding repentance

Where "repent"  is used in Bible:
| repent Mt3:2                                          | repent Mt4:17                                             | repent Ac2:18                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| John the baptist                                      | Jesus Christ                                              | Apostles                           |
| correction your knowledge of the divine and righteousness | turn from your direction towards the divine and turn to me | fix your thoughts towrds the divine |

repentance means turning

#### Yeshua is the Christ

- Mt16:16
> Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

- Ac17:3
> explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.

"Christ" "Messiah" = the Anointed (king)

| Christ                                             | Yeshua                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| King                                               | The name                                      |
| The Son of Man                                     | the Son of God                                |
| the mission of coming in the flesh                 | to whoever believes through the Holy Spirit   |
| Death, resurrection, ascension, the throne, return | Immanuel (Gos with us)                        |

### regarding love
#### 1.the redemption of God is done by God

- Mt20:28
> just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

- Rm5:6-8
> You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
- 1Jn4:10

only in Christianity there is the redemption of God.

#### 2. God gave men not doctrine but fact

- men killed Jesus but God raised Him

- the son of man sent the HS and the HS testifies

- Ac2:3
> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.

- Ac5:30-32
> The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
#### the lord's prayer is ***not*** a catechism(教理问答)

#### the content of prayer / How do we pray?

- the receiver of prayer
- the purpose of prayer
- the content of prayer: for His kingdom to grow, for His will to come true in my life

#### for His events He calls men and lets them do His work

- Ps23:1
- Eze44:28
> I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession.
---

## Lec 5

### 3. The christian mission is not a  religious method, it is declaring the gospel
Ac 16:31
> They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”

Jesus - preach - to save souls - Mt4:10

- to bring good news
- to proclaim/declare

#### Christianity does ***NOT*** challenge

- Jn18:36
- 1Ti6:20-21

social justice is human invention, God is just God, God is not socially just God

Christianity does ***not*** discuss or debate but ***declare***

truth cannot be debated / compromised

#### Ecumenism: to promote unity among the world's Christian churches

religious pluralism/unity

- 2Co6:14-18
- 1Jn5:16


### 4. Worship is ***NOT*** a religious ritual

We do not do the apostle's creed

worship = seeing the face of the Lord in spirit and truth
- Mt18:10

worship - to fall at another's feet - to meet with Him face to face - kiss

dead sacrifice(old testment)
/ living sacrifice(new testment)???

- Jn4:20-26
- 1Ki12:18-24, 27-33

| Jeroboam             | Rehoboam            |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 10 tribes of Isarael | Judah and Benjamin  |
| Northern Kingdom     | Southen kingdom     |
| High place in Bethel | Temple of Jerusalem |
| In spirit            | In Truth            |

#### God does not desire sacrifice but ***obedience***
- 1Sa15:22
- Ps51:26-27

### 5. The bible and faith

- He11:3
> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.

***? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?***

faith is warranted by the bible

the bible is testified by the faith

***? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?***

- Jn1:1-3

The Word = the self-manifestation = The face of god != The entirety of  god

- Mt11:12-13
- Jn1:14
- 1Co1:18-25

#### 1. the bible acknoweldges the works of God through faith

faith

- acknowledging that God has done and possessing it
- trusting the Word of God to be fullfilled

#### the treasure of God is in the Bible

need to have experience of Word

#### the Bible illusttrates that the works of God continue without breaks

| Genesis 1                | Hebrews 11                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| A chapter on God's faith | A chapter on men's faith  |
| all creations obeyed     | men obeyed                |
| "And it was so"          | "According to your faith" |

---

## Lec 7

### 7. the Bible was written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

- [2Ti3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2ti/3/16/s_1128016)
- [2Pe1:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2pe/1/21/s_1157021)
- [Jn14:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/14/26/s_1011026)

The four gospel books were written decades after Jesus' death.


### 8. the Bible is a mirror

- [1Co10:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/10/11/s_1072011)

the Bible is a mirror that reflects invisible ***spiritual*** beings

if you read the bible correctly, you will find Jesus

- [Jn5:39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/39/s_1002039)

the Bible is a tool that reflects the real image and lets you correct yourself

- [Jas1:23-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jas/1/23/s_1147023)
- [Tit3:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/tit/3/5/s_1132005)

- [Eph5:26-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eph/5/26/s_1102026)

reading the word of God (esp. NT), it makes us feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. We should feel guilty and cut to the heart. We find us in need of correcting.


### 9. the Bible says that God created the heavens and the earth and that He will also ***destroy*** them

- [2Pe3:7-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2pe/3/7/s_1159007)

God created the world by His Word, and also destroy it one day, for His plan and purpose.
The only "new thing" is Jesus, the truth

- [1Pe1:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1pe/1/5/s_1152005), [20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1pe/1/20/s_1152020)

the Holy Spirit lets us know that the prince of this world has been judged

- [Jn16:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/16/11/s_1013011)
- [Rev22:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/22/13/s_1189013)

2000 yrs ago when Jesus was crucified.

Bible is not a referential source but the foundation of faith and church.

God never intended the world to last forever. (global warming, nuclear warfare etc.)

the world is made ***for*** Jesus and by Jesus???

- [Mt24:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/24/3/s_953003), [40](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/24/40/s_953040)

#### ***Prophets*** are the servants who prepared the way for ***the Messiah***

- [Mt11:11-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/11/10/s_940010)

#### God's interst is in the blood of Jesus rather than in sin

- [1Co15:55-57](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/15/55/s_1077055)

Vietnam and Iraq for glory of America??? bad example (2022.5.7 is it bad example?)

### 12. read the bible knowing the purpose of god

1. material (cultural): to multiply - proliferation - ends
2. spiritual (holy): be holy - holiness - no end

what happend?

1. 1st: light, till today
2. 2nd: the expanse, till today
3. 3rd: plants and lands, till today
4. 4th: sun, moon and star, till today
5. 5th: fish and birds, till today
6. 6th: animals, men, till today
7. 7th: be blessed: holy - God's rest

Holiness = God's resting environment = to be set apart (different)
there is end to X but no end to holiness

### The sabbath and the holy day

# Chapter 3: spiritual beings / towards the end

# Lec 26

## I. the theory of angels

- Co4:19-20
- Ac1:8

rev HS -> power
"power" = angels

## 1. the beginning of angels

- Eze28:15,
  angels ("stars") = living spirits, angels live by life giving spirit

how do they live?

|                    |                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| for angels to live | keep their proper positions and duties, their position = life-giving spirit |
| the angel's sin    | leaving his proper domain: "I will ascend my throne"                        |
| to live again      | absolutely none                                                             |

|                  |                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| for adam to live | eat thte Word = obey, the Word = life, light                |
| adam's sin       | disobeyed the Word                                          |
| to live again    | eat the Word again, eat the flesh and drink the blood of JX |

life = light = the word (Jn1:4)
|   | cut off from LIFE  |the DEVIL|MAN|
|---|---|---|---|
| no light  | none to glorify  |the ruler of adrkness| fear darkness (Mt14:25-27)|
|no word| none to be governed by| the ruler of death| fear death (He2:15)|
|no truth| none to be sanctified by| the father of lies| doubt true words(Mt14:31)|

<br>

|           |                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the devil | left his proper position -> to Hades -> cannot return to heaven |
| JX        | sent (the Father's command) -> to Hades -> lifted up to heaven  |

angels to live = humility (service)
man to live = faith (obedience)

"know your position and stay there"?
"God hates the proud"

- Col2:18-19

| at creation        | Genesis 3          | Jesus                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| God - Man - Angels | God - Angels - Man | God - JX - Man(Christian) - Angels |

- He1:7

### believers' life-after-death

| the flesh      | the soul        | after resurrection  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| church         | paradise        | the Father's house  |
| the front yard | the living room | the master bedroom  |

- Jn3:13
- Jn20:17

### unbelievers' life-after-death

- took his own life

### 4.2 puts ***deceiving spirits*** into motion

- Jn3:13
- Jn20:17

the process of demon's invasion

1. evil thoughts -> 2. attached -> 3. depression -> 4. self-negligence, despair -> 5. total oppression

- Mal4:2
- Jn8:12

---

# Lec31

## 6. casting out demons is a exercising authority

- Mt28:18
- Mk16:17

### miracles

- the prophets - by the power of God
- JX - by the authority of God

| Majesty                    | Authority                | Power                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| throne, king - God Himself | the authortity of a king | the power, the works of a king |

- Rm13:1
- He1:3
- Jn12:31
- Mt21:23-24

### the authority of JX

- Jn10:18

(JX) the kingdom of heaven (the authority of live and die)-> the devil = the prince of the world (the ruler of death, to kill)

| JX                | the devil         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| authority to die  | authority to kill |
| authority to live |                   |
| - Mt12:26-28      |                   |

4. read the Bible (Jn10:35)
5. pray (Mt26:41; Mk9:29)

## III. the theory of the Holy Spirit (pneumatology)

- Jn14:16-20

JX - in history - visibly - to the world
HS - as Spirit - invisbly - to the souls (of believers)

### 1. the Holy Spirit is the person of God

intelligence: knows lies (Ac5;3) and deep things (2Co2:10)

emotion: groams (Rm8:26) nad rejoices (Lk10:21)

free will: in accordance with God's will (Rm8:27)

- Jn14:26
- 16:7-8

Jesus honored the Holy Spirit

- Rm8:9

| "the spirit of God"     | "the spirit of Christ" "the sprit of the Word" |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| the person of God (HS)) | the blood of Christ                            |

- Jn12:47-48

the command of JX = the command of Father = the command of HS

- Mt12:31-32, 36-37
- He10:28-29

the HS is confined in His work

- 1Co3:16-17

#### 1.1 Do not disobey the HS

- Gal5:17

  #### 1.2 Do not blaspheme against the HS

  disobey HS - passive - one's own problem<br>vs.<br>
  blaspheme against HS - active - external
1. the blasphemy against ***the Truth, the Gospel***
   - 2Ti2:8
   - Ac5:38-39
2. the blasphemy against ***the Church***
   - Ac20:28
   - Mt12:30

     #### 1.3 Do not limit the HS

# Lec 32

## 2. the HS is one person of the triune God
He is one with God
- Mt28:19
- Ac2:38

|Father   |Son   |HS|
|---|---|---|
|The ground being of ***esseence***   |the ground being of ***form***   | the ground being of ***spirit***|
|the Creator| the Redeemer| the Counselor|
|to the created| ***to the sinner***| ***to the saint***|

- Jn14:16-20

> 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever— 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.

    "I am in My Father"
    "and you are in me"
    "and I am in you"

interlocked

The One who made me  = the Father
The One who gave birth in His Blook = The Son
the One who nurtures me the spirit = The HS

the three persons are ***NOT*** ranked
- Mt29:19
- 2Co13:14

|Father   |Son   |HS|
|---|---|---|
|before history   |  in history |in history|
|heard from| visible| invisible|
|object of admiration| rejected and killed | into the souls that welcome|

The Father established,
the Son fullfilled,
HS is fullfilling,
the will.

- 1Jn5:6-8 (NKJV)
- Jn16:13
- 1Jn5:9

## 3. the HS is the counselor
- Jn14:16
### 3.1 the Counselor (Defender)
- Ac2:32-33
- Ac3:14-15
- AC5:30-32

### Why we must defend Jesus

- the world - found JX guilty - execution
- the cross - the cursed tree - total death
- HS - defends the innocence of JX (JX = the righteousness)

### 3.2 the Comforter
- Mt1:18
### 3.3 the Advocate
Jesus Himself is a Counselor
- 1Jn2:1

***counselor***
<br>
HS - defends JX - on earth
<br>
JX - defends saints - in heaven
