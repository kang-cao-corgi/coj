## Lec 1

# Intro

## Scripture cannot be broken

- [Jn10:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/10/35/s_1007035)
    > If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside

    referring to old testment, Bible cannot be destroyed
    The Word Jn1:1

#### the phrase "in the beginning" appears twice in the Bible

1. [Jn1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/1/s_998001) before creation, an eternal "time"
    > In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
1. [Ge1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/1/s_1001) the beginning of creation
    > In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

"In the beginning" also in Genesis1:1
Ge1:1 beginning of creation
Jn1:1 eternal time where there is no time, when the Word was before creation
What is WORD? the **self-manifestation** of God, everything else was created by God. The plan of human is already there.

### The Word is spirit.
Bible is the way we can know God, only through the Bible, we can know the whole logos. <br>
Those who have the Word of God are called ***gods*** [Jn10:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/10/35/s_1007035)

### What does Logos Bible institute teach?
It teaches how to view the Bible. It teaches the word.

### Do not re-interpret
not like theological school, which considers various sources of interpretation

---
# Chapter 1: How to look at the Bible - the "lens"
importance of lens: on way to see, on line in dial. zoom in and zoom out at different scope.

### The purpose of reading the Bible
eternal life [Jn5:39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/39/s_1002039)
> You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me.

eternal(no time involved, timeless) life is living like God. We must meet **Jesus** in the Bible. Bible is not an object of research. Theology, "theo" means study of God by human. We need approach the God through the Bible.

we must meet ***Jesus*** in the Bible

The Bible is <u>not</u> an object of research

## I.The Bible begins with a story of **3 types of spiritual beings** that are entirely different in their essence.

|God|Angels|Men|
|---|---|---|
|transcendant|intermediary|limited|
the creator, the beginning and the end [Rev22:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/22/13/s_1189013)|ministers, servants [He1:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/1/7/s_1134007), [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/1/14/s_1134014)|partners, heirs [Rm8:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/8/17/s_1054017); [1Co3:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/3/9/s_1065009)|

#### The main character in the Bible is **Jesus**
- [Jn8:56-58](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/8/56/s_1005056)
> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.” “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!” “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”

### 1. The purpose of the Bible is for man to know God
- [1Jn2:12-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/2/12/s_1161012)

### 2. approaches to read the Bible
|Greek approach| Hebrew approach|
|---|---|
|"how?"|"why"|
|method-driven|purpose-driven|
|man-centered (anthropocentrism)| God-centered (theocentricism)|

"Is God for man?" vs.
"Is man for God?"

#### **Eternal life** is knowing God who sent **Jesus** as the Son
- [Jn17:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/17/3/s_1014003) <br>
to know = to experience

#### you will know when you receive the HS
- [Jn14:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/14/17/s_1011017)
- [1Co2:10-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/2/10/s_1064010)

John's role was to introduce Jesus, after that he is finished (died).

#### We must hear the words of Jesus
### 2. men are destroyed for not knowing God
- [Hos4:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/hos/4/6/s_866006)
- [Hos6:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/hos/6/6/s_868006)
- [Jn16:2-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/16/2/s_1013002)

### 3. you will know the Lord
- [Hos2:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/hos/2/19/s_864019)
- [1Co13:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/13/12/s_1075012)
- [Rev3:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/3/20/s_1170020)

## Lec 2

### 4. The Bible distinguishes the natural revelation and higher revelation

| natural revelation | higher revelation |
| --- | --- |
| the Creator | the Savior |
| through the creation | through the Son |
| to all | to believers |
| [Ge1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/1/s_1001); [Rm1:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/1/19/s_1047019) | [Jn1:1-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/1/s_998001),[14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/14/s_998014),[18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/18/s_998018); [He1:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/1/1/s_1134001) |

- higher revelation can only be received after natural revelation.
  eg. knowledge believe

### The natural revelation - [Rm1:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/1/19/s_1047019)

#### Two different views on the origin of life
1. evolution - everything created w/o creator, highlights random process
1. creation <br>

### Evolution
Everything formed w/o direction.
#### The naturalistic view
- progressive creation: burst
- theistic evolution: god: let there be creatures, let it happen and evolve - directed evolution
- atheistic evolution: plain evolution learned in school

  #### cosmic evolution
  - the Big Bang Theory, the universe started with a small **singularity**, then inflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos of today.
  - but where did that singularity come from? multi-verse theory, Steve Hawkin - shrink boundary proposal
  #### geological evolution: the nebular hypothesis
  - the solar system formed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust 4.6 billion years ago.
  - but stardust particles do not form into planets and planetesimals rather they bounce off or collide to explide
  - the Earth: the solar-nebular model says the Earth was formed about 4.5 billions years ago. But its strong magnetic field, too little sodium in the sea, intact DNA in fossils etc. all indicate a young Earth
  - also the sun should be spinning much faster
  - the solar-nebular model sats eath was formed about 4.5 billion years ago
  - but its strong magnetic field too little sodium in the sea, intact DNA in fossils etc all indicate a YOUNG earth

    #### The Earth uniqely designed to be our home [Is45:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/isa/45/18/s_724018)
    - its strong magnetic field protects us from harmful solar radiation
    - its atmosphere gives us air to breathe
    - our sun is perfectly located within our galaxy; our planet is perfectly located within our solar system
    - its water cycle protects and provides

    #### The Moon
    - its distance from earth allows its gravity to rise tides for earth
    - its distance and size allows for eclipses
    - evolution cannot explain its origin, geological activity or its recession for "billions of years"

    #### A total solar eclipse
    - possible because the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and 400 times further away
    - because of this configuration eclipses can be best viewed on the earth
    - this configuration also allows for life to exist on earth

---

### The bibilical creation
- The 6 day creation
- The garden of Eden
- Adam and Eve
- The global flood etc

- [Ge1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/1/s_1001) " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
- "Day" = YOM (Hebrew)  = A Solar day

  [Ex20:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/exo/20/11/s_70011)
  > For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

---

### The theory of evolution
  Over a **gradual time-consuming** process a new speies arises from an existing one trough random spontaneous genetic mutations that give a surviaval advantae in to hostile environment

  ### Fossiles
  - evidence that Charles Darwin used for his theory in *On The Origins Of Species (1859)*
  - Q: Adam and Eve on 6th Day?
  - No found examples of in-between kinds: missing links? ***trasitional fossils***
  - The Archaeopteryx: a dinosaur or a bird?

### Puzzles that evolution cannot solve

#### 1. Life from non-life?
- The formation of the first living things that comes from nothing cannot be explained.

#### 2. Information of life (is evidence for creation)
- the information that is required to run all the physical parts of life cannot be explained
- the vast amount of the instructions stored in DNA had to come from preexisting information
- what is information?
    - the basic ingredient producing anything functional in the world
    - the key to functionality is organization
    - the fundamental building block of the created universe

#### 3. Irreducible complexity
Q: 99% human DNA being alike proves nothing of God's Design
- it challenges the notion of evolutionary process that requires every complex component of life arising step-by-step
- *Michael J. Behe* quote
- species that disapprove evolutionism
    - the bombardier beattle: 2 chambers
    - giraffe, the valve to prevent blood flowing to head when it bows down
    - leaf-cutter ant
- is evolution science?
- Scientific approach
    - objective observation
    - experiment: causal relationship criteria analysis
    - evidence
    - demostration: theories and laws

  ### Is evolution science?
  scientific method:
  - objective observation
  - experiment: caucal relationship, critical analysis
  - evidence
  - demonstration: theories and laws

  ### Evolution and Ceation commons
  - both **theories** make claims about the unobservable and unrepeatable past
  - both have the same evidence
  - both interpret base on a set of starting assumptions, different paradigms
  - both required ***faith***

Evolution denies the role of God in the universe

**Creation acceptes the bible as the foundation for arriving at a correct understanding of the universe, providing the answer to how, when and why all things came into existence**

### The higher revelation

- Jn1:1-3,14,18

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.

> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

- He1:1-2
- 1Jn1:1
- Jn1:16

---

## Lec 3 Culture

### II. The human world illustated in the Bbible is about ***the mutual and exclusive*** relationship between ***culture and faith***

#### Is culture first or faith?
culture = the environment where humans can be humans (live as)

[Ge1:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/28/s_1028)
  > God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground."

[Mt4:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/4/4/s_933004)
  > Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.

[Mt6:31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/6/31/s_935031),[33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/6/33/s_935033)
  >  So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or ‘What shall we wear?'

  > But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

Prioritize? faith all the time.
Following Lord's prayer

---

### The causal relationship between culture and faith

When men is tempted by culture, faith is cursed(corrupted), vice versa.

[Ps1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/psa/1/3/s_479003)
  > That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers.

[Eze47:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/47/12/s_849012)
  > Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.

1. challenging god because of food
    - [Ge3:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/1/s_3001)

1. hardship in life because of the coruption of faith
    - [Ge3:15-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/15/s_3015)

1. the invisible flaming sword <br>
    - representing an angel
    - [Ge3:22-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/22/s_3022)

    - [Dt28:30-34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/deu/28/30/s_181030)

    there is no earthly paradise, human can create society that is promised to be like paradise. In fact, there is no paradise on Earth any more.

1. when your faith reaches to God you will lose the world
    - [Ge4:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/4/1/s_4001)

1. the judgement of God brings out the fear among men
    - [Ge4:9-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/4/9/s_4009)

1.  the protection of God stops the tribulation(苦难，磨难) of culture
    - [Ge4:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/4/15/s_4015)

1. seeing the daughters of men, the sons of God became corrupted
    - [Ge6:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/6/1/s_6001)

---

### Heaven

### III. The Bible differentiates ***three heavens*** that are distinct in level and describes the events that develop in them

- [2Ch2:5-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2ch/2/5/s_369005), [6:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2ch/6/18/s_373018)


> The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?

> But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The ***heavens***, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!

- [Ps148:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/psa/148/4/s_626004)

> Praise him, you highest ***heavens*** and you waters above the skies.
### Three different heavens

| First heaven | second | third |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the heaven within the atmosphere | the heaven of the firmament, the expanse | the heaven where <u>***gods***</u> are |
| the sky [Ge1:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/28/s_1028) | the space, the universe [Ge1:6-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/6/s_1006) | the spiritual heaven [2Co12:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2co/12/2/s_1090002) |

small g gods -> angels

#### The universe is finite

- [Ac1:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/1/11/s_1019011)
    > "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."

- [Jn3:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/3/13/s_1000013)
    > No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.

#### Where is God?
God is omnipresent. the Son is in heaven. 3rd heaven was made/created

- [2Ch2:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2ch/2/6/s_369006)
    > But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?

#### The universe
- [Ge1:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/1/s_1001), [6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/6/s_1006)

#### Who governs where

| the heaven where <u>gods</u> are | the heaven of the Universe | the heaven under the clouds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| God | the ruler of the air [Eph2:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eph/2/2/s_1099002), [Job1:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/job/1/7/s_437007) | men [Ge1:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/1/28/s_1028) |

#### "Paradise" or "the Father's house"

| Paradise | Father's house |
| --- | --- |
| a portion of the third heaven   | the third heaven |
| souls of believers [Lk23:43](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/luk/23/43/s_996043) | in resurrected body [Jn14:2-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/14/2/s_1011002), [20:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/20/17/s_1017017) |

paradise: a spiritual space which is part of the third heaven.

### Hell
prepared mechanism of punishment for devils

#### When will anyone be thrown into hell
- [Mt25:31-41](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/25/31/s_954031)
- [Jude1:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jde/1/6/s_1167006)

## Lec 4

## III. Religion, though unclearly, demonstrations the common organization and deeds of faith

### <u>Christianity is ***not*** a religion</u>

religion = giving reverence to the super natural or transcendent

Christian faith exists without the text

| religion | Christianity |
| --- | --- |
| general, natural faith | faith by revelation, faith by grace |
| through doctrines, rituals and organization | through the revealed Word of God |
| Upward | Downward |

### Religiosity vs. Faith

- [1Co15:13-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/15/13/s_1077013)
- [Ac2:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/32/s_1020032)

#### you cannot know God through philosophy

Philosophy is the basis of knowledge?
Could you know god through philosophy?

#### Two approaches in Greek philosophy to understand *deity though reason*

1. The ontological approach

    (ontological: the state of being/existence)
   - "God is that, the greater than which cannot the conceived(感知)" - Anselm of Canterbury
   - "I have concluded the evident existence depends entirely on God in all the moments of my life,
   that I do not think that the human spirit may know anything with greater evidence and certitude(确信)" - Rene Descartes
   - understand God through the external
   - God as the ground of being , the nature of being
   - man cannot be separated to objectify God
   - "Since I exist, god must exist"
   - "I become the divine, the divine becomes me" - the concluding statement

    god = "emptyness"<br>
    the immanence theory / pantheism = god is inseparable from<br>
    you cannot prove/disprove existence of God<br>

2. The idealistic approach

    (the mind is the requirement of existence)

   - understand God through the internal

   - God as the origin of the mind

   - the eye cannot see itself

   - the consciousness of man is the consciousness of God

   - the divine = nothingness, emptiness, meaninglessness<br>
    nihilism(尼采) <-> buddhism: reality being empty, full of suffering because of cravings, nothing is permanent, nothing is cause-less

#### Neither philosophy nor religion can know the divine.
- [Mt11:25-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/11/25/s_940025)

> At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

*children* are those who are pure-minded and bumble-hearted.

#### The Bible offers evidence for Faith: the resurrection of Jesus
- [1Co15:13-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/15/13/s_1077013)
- [Ac2:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/32/s_1020032)

#### Christianity is responding to the divine call

#### Christianity is a faith of confession

| action | confession | acknowledgement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| worship | revealing my faith | God's omnipresence |
| repentance | confessing my sins | God's righeousness, omniscience |
| prayer | confessing my inabilites | God's omnipotence |
| praise | confessing my lowliness  | God's worthiness |
| tithing | revealing my income | God's ownership of all things |
| thanksgiving | revealing my life | God's grace and help |

praise: exalt 1. who He is, 2. what He has done and 3. His name
- [Rm10:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/10/10/s_1056010)
- [Jn1:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/9/s_998009)

### 1. God gave men not religion but His Son

#### regarding repentance

Where "repent"  is used in Bible:
| repent [Mt3:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/3/2/s_932002) | repent [Mt4:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/4/17/s_933017) | repent [Ac2:38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/38/s_1020038) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John the baptist | Jesus Christ | Apostles |
| correction your knowledge of the divine and righteousness | turn from your direction towards the divine and turn to me | fix your thoughts towards the divine |

repentance means turning

#### Yeshua is the Christ

- [Mt16:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/16/16/s_945016)
> Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

- [Ac17:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/17/3/s_1035003)
> explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.

"Christ" "Messiah" = the Anointed (king)

| Christ | Yeshua |
| --- | --- |
| King | The name |
| The Son of Man | the Son of God |
| the mission of coming in the flesh | to whoever believes through the Holy Spirit |
| Death, resurrection, ascension, the throne, return | Immanuel (God with us) |

### Regarding love
the redemption of God

- [Mt20:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/20/28/s_949028)
> just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

- [Rm5:6-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/5/6/s_1051006)
> You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
- [1Jn4:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/4/10/s_1163010)

only in Christianity there is the redemption of God.

### 2. God gave men not doctrine but fact

- men killed Jesus but God raised Him

- the son of man sent the HS and the HS testifies Him

- [Ac2:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/3/s_1020003)
> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.

- [Ac5:30-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/5/30/s_1023030)
> The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”

#### The lord's prayer is <u>not</u> a catechism(教理问答)

#### The content of prayer / How do we pray?

- the receiver of prayer
- the purpose of prayer
- the content of prayer: for His kingdom to grow, for His will to come true in my life

#### for His events He calls men and lets them do His work
- [Ps23:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/psa/23/1/s_501001)
- [Eze44:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/44/28/s_846028)
> I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession.

## Lec 5

### 3. The Christian mission is not a  religious method, it is declaring the gospel
- [Ac16:31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/16/31/s_1034031)
> They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”

Jesus - preach - to save souls - [Mt4:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/4/10/s_933010)

preach <br>
- to bring good news
- to proclaim/declare

#### Christianity does ***NOT*** challenge

- [Jn18:36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/18/36/s_1015036)
- [1Ti6:20-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1ti/6/20/s_1125020)

social justice is human invention, God is just God, God is not socially just God

Christianity does ***not*** discuss or debate but ***declares***

truth cannot be debated / compromised

#### Ecumenism: to promote unity among the world's Christian churches

religious pluralism/unity

- [2Co6:14-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2co/6/14/s_1084014)
- [1Jn5:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/5/16/s_1164016)


?? [1Jn5:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/5/17/s_1164017)

### 4. Worship is ***NOT*** a religious ritual

We do not do the apostle's creed

worship = seeing the face of the Lord in spirit and truth
- [Mt18:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/18/10/s_947010)

worship - to fall at another's feet - to meet with Him face to face - kiss the hand of God

dead sacrifice(old testment)
/ living sacrifice(new testment)???

- [Jn4:20-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/4/20/s_1001020)
- [1Ki12:18-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1ki/12/18/s_303018), [27-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1ki/12/27/s_303027)

| Jeroboam | Rehoboam |
| --- | --- |
| 10 tribes of Isarael | Judah and Benjamin |
| Northern Kingdom | Southen kingdom |
| High place in Bethel | Temple of Jerusalem |
| In Spirit | In Truth(law) |

#### God does not desire sacrifice but ***obedience***
- [1Sa15:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1sa/15/22/)
- [Ps51:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/psa/51/16/s_529016)

## V. The Bible and faith

- [He11:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/11/3/s_1144003)
> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.

***? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?***

***? faith is warranted by the Bible &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?***

***? the Bible is testified by the faith ?***

***? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?***

- [Jn1:1-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/1/s_998001)

    The Word = the self-manifestation = The face of God != The entirety of God

- [Mt11:12-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/11/12/s_940012)
- [Jn1:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/14/s_998014)
- [1Co1:18-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/1/18/s_1063018)

#### 1. the Bible acknoweldges the works of God through faith

faith is ... <br>
- acknowledging what God has done and possessing it
- trusting the Word of God to be fullfilled

#### the treasure of God is in the Bible

need to have experience of Word

#### the Bible illusttrates that the works of God continue without breaks
- [He11:29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/11/29/s_1144029)

| Genesis 1 | Hebrews 11 |
| --- | --- |
| A chapter on God's faith | A chapter on men's faith  |
| all creations obeyed | men obeyed |
| "And it was so" | ***"According to your faith"*** |

---

## Lec 6

### 2. the Bible emphasizes obedience by faith

### what is faith?

#### Self-confidence (believe in the self)

#### ***Faith***
- the faith in/of God
- the assurance of God
- objective
- base on the Word of God
- 100% of God's guarantee for success

[Mt14:25-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/14/25/s_943025), Jesus walked on water and ***commanded*** Peter to walk on water.

#### Have faith in God - [Mk11:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mar/11/22/s_968022)

#### Now faith is ***the substance*** of things hoped for and ***the evidence*** of things not seen - [He11:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/heb/11/1/s_1144001), NKJV

### 3. Those who absolutely trust the Bible as the Word of god have Godly authority [Jn5:24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/24/s_1002024)

#### the authority of the Son of Man

- the authority to ***judge sins*** [Jn5:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/27/s_1002027) and ***forgive sins*** [Mt9:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/9/6/s_938006)
- the authority ***to die*** and the authority ***to live*** [Jn10:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/10/18/s_1007018)

the target of His judgement = the origin os sin = the devil

the subject of his forgiveness = souls of men, because they were deceived

#### the authority of preachers

- [Mk3:13-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mar/3/13/s_960013)

### 4. not even a part of the Bible can be abolished/dismissed because it is all about Jesus

old testment: a robe divided into pieces
new testment: a robe assembled and put on by Jesus

### 5. the Bible can be verified through faith

Jesus is testified by

1. the Bible [Jn5:29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/29/s_1002029)
2. the prophets [Jn1:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/34/s_998034)

- [Jn6:63](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/6/63/s_1003063)

### Why did Word become ***flesh***?

- ***To die***: for redemption [Mt20:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/20/28/s_949028)

- ***To shed blood***: to cleanse, forgive sins and give life [Lev17:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/lev/17/11/s_107011), [Jn6:63](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/6/63/s_1003063), [He9:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/9/22/s_1142022)

    his death = to pay the price of sin

### Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God
- [Mt16:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/16/16/s_945016)

"Christ" = his duty/mission as man
(the "anointed")
"the son of God" = his essence

#### Those who deny the death of Jesus are satanic
- [1Jn4:2-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/4/2/s_1163002)

## Lec 7

### 7. the Bible was written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit

- [2Ti3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2ti/3/16/s_1128016)
- [2Pe1:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2pe/1/21/s_1157021)
- [Jn14:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/14/26/s_1011026)

The four gospel books were written decades after Jesus' death.


### 8. the Bible is a mirror

- [1Co10:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/10/11/s_1072011)

the Bible is a mirror that reflects invisible ***spiritual*** beings

if you read the bible correctly, you will find Jesus

- [Jn5:39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/39/s_1002039)

the Bible is a tool that reflects the real image and lets you correct yourself

- [Jas1:23-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jas/1/23/s_1147023)
- [Tit3:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/tit/3/5/s_1132005)

- [Eph5:26-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eph/5/26/s_1102026)

reading the word of God (esp. NT), it makes us feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. We should feel guilty and cut to the heart. We find us in need of correcting.


### 9. the Bible says that God created the heavens and the earth and that He will also ***destroy*** them

- [2Pe3:7-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2pe/3/7/s_1159007)

God created the world by His Word, and also destroy it one day, for His plan and purpose.

#### The only "new thing" is Jesus, the truth

- [He1:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/1/2/s_1134002)
- [1Pe1:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1pe/1/5/s_1152005), [20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1pe/1/20/s_1152020)

the Holy Spirit lets us know that the prince of this world has been judged

- [Jn16:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/16/11/s_1013011)
- [Rev22:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/22/13/s_1189013)

2000 yrs ago when Jesus was crucified.

Bible is not a referential source but the foundation of faith and church.

God never intended the world to last forever. (global warming, nuclear warfare etc.)

the world is made ***for*** Jesus and by Jesus???

- [Mt24:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/24/3/s_953003), [40](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/24/40/s_953040)
- [Lk17:34-35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/luk/17/34/s_990034)

Jesus will come back like a lightning.

### 10. the Old Testment is a prophecy of the coming of the messiah; while the New Testment is a prophecy of the coming of the kingdom of Christ

- Ge18:10
- Mt3:2

| Old Testment | New Testment |
| --- | --- |
| Genesis &rarr; Luke | John &rarr; Revelation |
| the King who will come according to the prophecy | the King who will return according to the prophecy |
| "the coming Messiah" | "Christ who came",  "Christ who will return" |

#### ***Prophets*** are the servants who prepared the way for ***the Messiah***

- [Mt11:10-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/11/10/s_940010)

Moses 1500 B.C. the Pentatuch, the first five books.

last book of old testment Nakachi 400 B.C.

400 B.C. -> 0 A.D.the dark age of Isareal, the intertestamental period.
"the dark history of Israel", no prophet

70 A.D. -> 100 A.D., the New Testment is finished

| Faction | Pharisees | Scribes | Sadducees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ***Social class*** | middle | lower | Priests, aristocrats   |
| ***emphasis*** | the law | the law   | Priestly obligations |
| ***rigteousness*** | deeds | knowledge | Charity ("good" works) |
| ***afterlife*** | yes | [yes] | no |

the pharistic law + 613 commandments of Moses
30 regarding sabbath

- [2Th1:7-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/2th/1/7/s_1117007)

### 11. The object of ***God's interest*** is in the Bible

#### regarding Judas Iscariot

- [Jn13:26-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/13/26/s_1010026) "satanic thought entered him"
- [Mk14:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mar/14/21/s_971021)

#### The purpose of the coming of the Son of God
<!-- XXX: listen again! -->
1. to ***glorify*** the Father - the ***purpose*** of God [Php2:6-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/phl/2/6/s_1105006)
1. to ***destory*** (the works of) the devil - the ***mission*** of God [1Jn3:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/3/8/s_1162008)
1. to ***save*** mankind - the ***will*** of God [Jn3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/3/16/s_1000016)



#### God's interst is in the blood of Jesus rather than in sin

- [1Co15:55-57](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/15/55/s_1077055)

Vietnam and Iraq for glory of America??? bad example
- (2022.5.7) is it bad example?
- (2023.5.13) USA went to vietnam not for the love of vietnam people (but for the glory of America?), saving man is just a side effect

---

## Lec 8

### 12. Read the Bible knowing the purpose of God

knowing God is faith
- unbelievers: deny the existance of God
- the antichrist: denies the fact that Jesus came in flesh (they do not believe Jesus is Son of God, incarnation of God)
- cults: insist on salvation other than Jesus

#### The Bible cannot be interpreted without the works of the Holy Spirit
- [Ac2:44-47](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/44/s_1020044)

Is communism/socialism a perfect world??? Soviet Union is not a perfect instance.

#### The Bilble acknowledges differences (inequalities)

- [Ge25:23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/25/23/s_25023)

Jesus Christ has to surrender to the will of God

| men | Jesus |
| --- | --- |
| Exist ***for Jesus*** | came in flesh ***for men*** |
| from the point of the will of God | from the point of salvation |
| the attribute of God (the God who has will) | the character(heart) of God (to save mankind) |

anthropocentricism vs. theocentricism

"If you see the greater things, you will let go the petty things"

"Be fearless before world, be fearful before God"

#### the Bible is the word of the Holy Spirit
- [Jn5:39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/5/39/s_1002039) Jesus is original copy of Bible

### 13. the Bible must be read only through the lens of the ***blood of Jesus***

from Genesis to Revelation , it is all about the history and the story of ***the blood***

#### God's interest is solely in the blood

- [Ex12:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/exo/12/13/s_62013), [21-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/exo/12/21/s_62021)

- [Ex24:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/exo/24/8/s_74008)
- [He10:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/10/1/s_1143001), [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/10/14/s_1143014)

#### experience the event of the blood of Jesus

| Old Testment | New Testment |
| --- | --- |
| a story written with the blood of lamb | a story written with ***the blood of God*** |
| the coming of the one who will shed blood | His return to ***collect the shed blood***  |

#### Why is the blood of Jesus important?

1. if there is blood, eternal life; if not, destruction [Jn3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/3/16/s_1000016)

#### ***The gospel*** is the freedom from conscience

- [Jn8:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/8/32/s_1005032)

- If you see John as prophet -> Jesus is Christ
- If you see Jesus as a prophet -> must wait for the Messiah

#### Jesus is the light of life

- [Ac4:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/4/13/s_1022013)

***2022***: Tracks/rail ways as God's plan, the train running as "schedule" (does not stop or change).
Providence, as the sleeper, is the individual's life to meet God's plan.<br>
Sleeper has a free will: "yes" -> blessing, "no" -> curse

***2019***: The track is the will of God, the train is the schedule, and providence is the individual piece of sleeper, which involves risk. If carry it out, there is blessing, if not, there is curse.

- [Rm5:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/5/18/s_1051018) died on the cross, being obedient

"knowing good and evil" <br> != normal terms <br> = knowing life / resurrection &rarr; death

- [Lk12:49-50](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/luk/12/49/s_985049) death

#### The Fruit of the tree of life
- [Ge3:22-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/22/s_3022)

#### ***Satanic*** sin and ***disobedient*** sin
- Satanic sin cannot be forgiven
- Disobedient sin can be forgiven

the **sin** htat leads to death - unbelief &rarr; hell <br>
the **sin** that does <u>not</u> lead to death - disobedience &rarr; curse

Sin = being deceived by the deceiver - unbelief <br>
The truth = the law that does <u>not</u> deceive - disobedience

- [1Jn5:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1jo/5/16/s_1164016)

First Adam is a boat, attach to God. When Adam sinned, sin and death entered all men [Rm5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/5/12/s_1051012), [1Co15:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/15/22/s_1077022), the anker broke and boat is going backwards down to a waterfall(hell, lake of fire) [Rev20:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/20/15/s_1187015). God sent His Son as the last Adam, coming to die and send the Holy Spirit (as another boat going up forward) to ask them to repent [Ac2:38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/2/38/s_1020038) and jump off the first boat to join the second boat.

## XIII. The spirit of man is transmitted
#### (the spirit of man and the redemption of Christ)
- [Ge2:18-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/2/18/s_2018)

#### Theories on the transmission(inheritance) of the spirit
- The pre-existence theory (the spirit exists before conception, "spirit in-stock to be sent by God")
- Creationism (God creates each spirit on-spot during conception)
- Traducianism (one spirit is passed down to the next)
<br><br>


one spirit
- [Mal2:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mal/2/15/s_927015)
- [Rm5:12-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/5/12/s_1051012) Spiritually there is only one spirit, through one Adam (like iris)


"the spirit of Christ aka. the blood of Christ"

The spirit of Adam is inherited <br>
vs. <br>
The spirit of Christ is <u>NOT</u> inherited.

XXX: good questions for test

#### Different types of sins

| the original sin  |self-commited sin   |the sin of desire|
|---|---|---|
| Adam's sin  |individual sin (the corruption of the person)  | the tendency/character of sin|
|death of the spirit|curse|curse|
|inherited [Ps51:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/psa/51/5/s_529005)|<u>Not</u> inherited [Eze18:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/18/1/s_820001), [17-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/18/17/s_820017)|<u>Not</u> inherited [Eze18:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/18/1/s_820001), [17-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/18/17/s_820017)|

Mary was there to receive Holy Spirit


Jesus(flesh) <br>= the Spirit of the Word <br>= the Spirit of Christ <br> = the Last Adam

Jesus did not receive anything from Mary at birth
<br><br>

The spirit of the first Adam - divides, inherited <br>
vs. <br>
the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the last Adam - <u>not</u> inherited

our sin was nailed to the cross with His body (atonement, redemption)

- [Jn1:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/12/s_998012) everyone were redeemed, but have to believe and receive to be saved
- [Eph2:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eph/2/1/s_1099001)

#### Redemption and the Forgiveness of Sin

redemption was at 2000 years ago, now is us to believe. The effect of redemption is forgiveness, but can be received only after belief (by faith). We see it as grace of God.

"grafted(嫁接) from first Adam's tree to last Adam's tree, through the <u>Holy Spirit</u>"

| born-again | sanctification |
|---|---|
| the change in essence  |the change in form |
|one time|<u>continuous</u>|
|by the works of Christ|by my works|

sanctification: be holy, be set apart from the world, do not live the lust of flesh

## XIV. The fig leaves and the garments of skin (human civilization and spiritual grace)
- [Ge3:6-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/6/s_3006), [21-22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/21/s_3021)

- Fig leaves: put together by Adam and Eve &rarr; man's method
- Garments of skin: God's grace

knowing "good and evil" not in moral terms <br>
In spiritual terms: associated waht they have done, understanding the problem of life and death

#### The fruit:
1. good for food [Dan1:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/dan/1/8/s_851008) men loses the right to food, "nobody gets free food"
2. pleasing to the eye [Ge6:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/6/2/s_6002) for aesthetics
3. desirable for gaining wisdom [Rev13:15-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/13/15/s_1180015)

#### ***How it applies to the modern life***

1. keeping the ethics and the lineage of the family [Ge3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/16/s_3016)
2. the order of materials [Ge3:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/3/17/s_3017)
3. the life that lives by the grace of God

"Faith life is knowing how to adjust to worldly culture. wisdom and self-discipline to put boundary"

## XV. The day God made holy
- [Ge2:1-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/2/1/s_2001)

### Two types of God's ***blessings*** @ creation
1. Material (cultural): to multiply - proliferation(增生, 繁殖) - ends
2. Spiritual (holy): be holy - holiness - no end

#### What happend in 7-day-creation?

1. light, till this day
2. the firmament, the expanse, till this day
3. lands and plants, till this day
4. sun, moon and stars, till this day
5. fish and birds, till this day
6. animals, men and women, till this day
<br> &uarr; all will end
---
7. blessing, make it holy &rarr; holy - God's rest - special, spiritual blessing

Holiness = God's resting environment = to be set apart (different)

There is end to all things but no end to holiness

### The Sabbath and the Holy Day

***the Sabbath***: (Hebrew שַׁבָּת Šabbāṯ) the day in which God rested (The seventh day) (Jews keep it today)

***the holy day***: the day God made holy

| offspring of Adam (offspring of ***Seth***) | living being | ***"Sons of God"*** |
| Nephilim | no spirit    | "daughters of men" |
|Mixed offspring (of two groups)|No spirit|"daughters of men"|

why son of Seth? <br>
Noah was descendent of <u>neither</u> Cain and Abel.

### The descendants of Seth

1. Adam &lrhar; Noah [Ge4:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/4/26/s_4026); [1Pe3:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1pe/3/19/s_1154019)
   - (the original sin) no other commandment received.
   - no revelation (faint)
   - no covenant
2. Noah &lrhar; Moses [Ge9:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/gen/9/4/s_9004)
   - given commandment, original sin, spiritual sin

    Paradise locates across over second and third heaven, which contains Father's house. The part of which lies in second heaven is called spiritual prison, but not hell. The part which lies in third heaven is called Abraham's boson or side

    1. people before Noah, no resurrection &rarr; serving God (became angels)
    1. believers from Noah to Jesus(covenant of blood) (in OT), go to Abraham's side, will come to 2nd resurrection &rarr; servants of God
    1. believers after Jesus &rarr; paradise, eligible for 1st resurrection &rarr; heirs of God

| Man | the condition for the death of Jesus (the flesh and sin) |
| The law | the context of the death of Jesus |

- [Rev20:4-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/20/4/s_1187004)

saints vs. believers <br>
"the resurrection of the righteous is the 1st resurrection"

### The first Adam and the last Adam connections

the body of Jesus and the spirit of man are on the same level. <br>
the last Adam has no flesh thus no tendency to sin (flesh = life-giving spirit = the last Adam)

? "drink my blood, eat my flesh" is it related to communion ?

#### Redemption and the forgeveness of sin

# Chapter 3: Spiritual beings

## Lec 26

## I. The theory of angels

- [1Co4:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/1co/4/19/s_1066019)
- [Ac1:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/1/8/s_1019008)

rev HS -> power
"power" = angels being revealed

### 1. The beginning of angels

- [Eze28:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/eze/28/15/s_830015) <br>
  - "blameless" -> (is fulfilling the role) "perfect" (KJV)
  - "you" = angels ("stars") = "living spirits", live by the life-giving spirit (God)
  - wickedness surfaces

#### How do they live?

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| for angels to live | - keep their proper positions and duties <br> - ***their position = life-giving spirit*** |
| the angel's sin | left his proper domain: "I will ascend my throne" |
| to live again | absolutely none |

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| for Adam to live | - ***eat the Word = obey*** <br> - the Word = life, light |
| Adam's sin | disobeyed the Word |
| to live again | - eat the Word again <br> - eat the flesh and drink the blood of JX |

life = light = the Word [Jn1:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/jhn/1/4/s_998004)

|   | cut off from life  |the devil| man |
|---|---|---|---|
| no light  | ... to glorify  |the ruler of darkness| fear darkness [Mt14:25-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/14/25/s_943025)|
|no word| ... to be governed by| the ruler of death| fear death [He2:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/heb/2/15/s_1135015)|
|no truth| ... to be sanctified by| the father of lies| doubt true words [Mt14:31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/14/31/s_943031)|

<br>

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| the devil | left his proper position &rarr; to Hades &rarr; cannot return to heaven |
| JX | sent (the Father's command) &rarr; to Hades &rarr; lifted up to heaven |

angels to live = humility (service), opposite of pride <br>
man to live = ***faith*** (obedience)

"know your position and stay there"? <br>
"God hates the proud"

- [Col2:18-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/col/2/18/s_1109018)

| at creation | Genesis 3 | Jesus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| God - Man - Angels | God - Angels - Man | God - JX - Man(Christian) - Angels |

### 3. Different types of angels and their roles

#### 3.1 One's own angels

- [Mt18:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/18/10/s_947010)
- [Ac12:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/act/12/15/s_1030015)
  - (review, 1 or 2, highly chance for test)
  - we are 2 beings, living 2 lives
- [Rev8:3-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rev/8/3/s_1175003)
    - the Holy Spirit &rarr; I must obey &rarr; re-live the public life(ministry) of Christ (live like Christ)
    - angels &rarr; I must use them &rarr; to help me to re-live that life
    - [Rm12:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/rom/12/1/s_1058001) different gifts to answer the calling to be used according to the HS
